# rtimedb: A Long Term Project Time-Series Database written in Rust

> [!CAUTION]
> **WARNING: Extremely Experimental**

> `rtimedb` is in a very early stage of development and is considered highly experimental. It is not suitable for production use. Please do not rely on this for any critical data or applications, as it may lead to data loss or other unexpected issues. This project is a playground for learning and exploration in the domain of time-series databases.

## About rtimedb

Welcome to `rtimedb`, a long-term project written in Rust, aimed at building a real-time time-series database from scratch. This project is my journey through learning and experimenting with data storage and retrieval techniques for time-series data.

### Current Stage

As of now, `rtimedb` is exploring foundational concepts such as basic data insertion and retrieval, designing a simple yet effective storage format, and understanding time-based indexing. Just getting started, and there's much to learn and implement!

### Features (Planned and Current)

- **Storage Exploration**: Experimenting with different storage and indexing strategies.
- **Data Ingestion**: Simple API endpoints to ingest time-series data.
- **Query Mechanism**: Basic querying capabilities based on time and key.

## Getting Involved

This project is very much a work in progress, and I'm open to ideas, discussions, and contributions! Here's how you can get involved:

- **Feedback**: Suggestions on features, design, and technology choices are welcome.
- **Code**: Contributions to code, be it new features or bug fixes.
- **Learning Together**: Share resources, articles, and knowledge on time-series databases.
